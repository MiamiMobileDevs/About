# Good Habits

Commit often. Even though it is mandatory to commit once during our meet, we encourage developers to commit often and at least once a day. Keep your project going and don't break the chain! 
Don't hesitate to ask for help. We reserve the last 15 minutes of our meet to crowd source any problems anyone may be having. Ask questions and answer questions!
